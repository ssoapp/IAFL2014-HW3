ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:
Design a simple form to cut/engrave on the laser using your own materials.
"Simple" meaning something you can cut out of a single sheet of a material of your choice no larger than 18"x12".

HOMEWORK DESCRIPTION:
The purpose of this assignment was to start using the laser-cutter by creating a simple design on our chosen material. 
I decided to create a template for small wooden charms as a test for how precise the laser-cutter would be and what a good size for a charm/the hole for a strap should be. 
It was also an exercise for me to get some practice drawing with Adobe Illustrator. IÅfm pretty pleased with the results based on the precision and overall finish and hope to make more in the future with better designs. 
The only problem I am having with my finished pieces is light scorching on the front and heavy scorching or burning from the bed on the back. 
I hope to resolve this issue with a bit more testing and am also interesting in painting or staining the wood. 
Hopefully, engraving designs onto future piece will also make the scorches less visible on the front. My goal is to make enough of these to (hopefully) sell, or hand out as gifts for years if they donÅft. 
IÅfm also interested in moving on to laser-cutting illustrations on wood.
